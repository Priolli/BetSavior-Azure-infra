# BetSavior Azure Functions Local Development Issue Documentation

## Problem Summary

While attempting to run Azure Functions locally for the BetSavior project (Node.js, TypeScript, Durable Functions), the host failed to recognize any job functions, consistently reporting:

> No job functions found. Try making your function a 'public' method.

This occurred despite the following:
- Correct project structure and function.json files
- Valid TypeScript compilation to dist/
- Proper entryPoint and scriptFile configuration
- Updated extensionBundle in host.json
- Node.js v20.15.1 environment

## Diagnostic Steps Taken

1. **Verified Project Structure**
   - All function folders present with function.json and corresponding .ts/.js files.
   - Durable Functions orchestrators and activities correctly placed.

2. **Checked function.json Files**
   - Each function.json had correct bindings, entryPoint, and scriptFile paths.

3. **Validated Build Output**
   - TypeScript compiled successfully to dist/.
   - All required JS files present and exported as default.

4. **Confirmed Extension Bundle**
   - host.json uses extensionBundle version "[4.*, 5.0.0)" for runtime v4 compatibility.

5. **Checked Node.js Version**
   - Node.js v20.15.1 confirmed.

6. **Inspected for Missing Configurations**
   - Discovered that worker.config.json was missing, which is required for Node.js isolated worker projects in Azure Functions Core Tools v4+.

## Still no soluction founded.
